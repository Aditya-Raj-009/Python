# single line comment.
""" Multi line comment. """
print("Subscribe Now")
print("also like video") # automatically print in new line.

# but if u want that no new line comes after print statements then:
print("This means not add any thing after this",end="")
print("print in same line")

# you can add any at the end of print statements:
print("ok again",end=",")
print("in same line separated by comma")

# you can also print two statements in a single print statement:
print("We are legends", "yes we are", end="")

#if u want to print \n :
print("C:\nHarry") # C and Harry print in different line as \n is a escape sequence which use for new line.
print("C:\\nHarry") # now it will print in same line and also \n will print.
